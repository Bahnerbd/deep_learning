# PyTorch implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks(DCGAN)

## Overview
Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) is a generative model that learns to mimic a data distribution using adversarial loss(with/without other problem specific losses such as perceptual loss) with the help of a discriminator network, thereby enabling the generator network to produce images from the target distribution.

DCGAN consists of two main components:
1. Generator: A fully convolutional network that maps a random vector 'z' to an image.
2. Discriminator: A fully convolutional network that classifies an input image as 'real' or 'fake'.
